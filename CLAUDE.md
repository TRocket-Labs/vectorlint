# Repository Guidelines

This repository implements VectorLint — a prompt‑driven, structured‑output content evaluator. Use this guide to navigate the codebase, run it locally, and contribute safely.

## Project Structure & Module Organization

- `src/`
  - `index.ts` — CLI entry; orchestrates config, discovery, evaluation, reporting
  - `boundaries/` — external data validation (config, CLI args, env vars, YAML, API responses)
  - `chunking/` — content chunking for large documents (recursive chunker, merger, utilities)
  - `cli/` — command definitions and CLI orchestration
  - `config/` — configuration loading and management
  - `errors/` — custom error types and validation errors
  - `evaluators/` — evaluation logic (base evaluator, registry, specific evaluators)
  - `output/` — TTY formatting (reporter, evidence location, line numbering)
  - `prompts/` — YAML frontmatter parsing, schema validation, directive loading
  - `providers/` — LLM abstractions (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, Gemini), request builder, provider factory
  - `scan/` — file discovery (fast‑glob) honoring config and exclusions
  - `schemas/` — Zod schemas for all external data (API responses, config, CLI, env)
  - `scoring/` — score calculation (density-based for check, rubric-based for judge)
  - `types/` — TypeScript type definitions
- `presets/` — bundled rule packs (e.g., `VectorLint/`)
- `tests/` — Vitest specs for config, scanning, evaluation, providers

## Configuration System

### Quick Start

Run `vectorlint init` to generate configuration files. This automatically sets up:
- `.vectorlint.ini` with `RunRules=VectorLint` (the bundled preset)
- `~/.vectorlint/config.toml` for LLM provider API keys

### Bundled Presets

VectorLint ships with a `VectorLint` preset in `presets/VectorLint/` containing:
- `ai-pattern.md` — Detects AI-generated writing patterns
- `pseudo-advice.md` — Detects pseudo-advice (vague guidance without actionable details)
- `repetition.md` — Detects redundant content between sections

**Presets are automatically available** — no need to set `RulesPath` to use them. Just set:

```ini
[**/*.md]
RunRules=VectorLint
```

### Custom Rules

For custom rules, set `RulesPath` to your rules directory:

```ini
RulesPath=.github/rules

[**/*.md]
RunRules=Acme
```

Rules must be organized into subdirectories (packs) within `RulesPath`.

### Zero-Config Mode

If you just want to evaluate against a user instruction guide without specific rules:
1. Create a `VECTORLINT.md` file with your user instruction content
2. Run `vectorlint doc.md` — VectorLint creates a synthetic rule from your user instructions

## Build, Test, and Development Commands

- `npm run dev -- <paths>` — run CLI with tsx (no build)
- `npm run build` — bundle with tsup (ESM, sourcemaps, type declarations)
- `npm start <paths>` — run built CLI
- `npm run lint` — run ESLint
- `npm run lint:fix` — run ESLint with auto-fix
- `npm test` — Vitest in watch mode
- `npm run test:run` — single test run
- `npm run test:ci` — run with coverage

## Prompt Architecture

VectorLint assembles prompts in this order:

1. **Directive** (`src/prompts/directive-loader.ts`) — Role definition, task, and evaluation instructions
2. **User Instructions** (`VECTORLINT.md`) — Optional global style context
3. **Rule** (the prompt body from the rule file) — Specific evaluation criteria

The content to evaluate is sent as a **user message** with line numbers prepended.

### Chunking

For documents >600 words, VectorLint automatically chunks content:
- Uses recursive splitting (paragraphs → lines → sentences → words)
- Each chunk is evaluated separately
- Results are merged and deduplicated
- Disable with `evaluateAs: document` in rule frontmatter

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions

- TypeScript ESM; prefer explicit imports and narrow types
- Indentation: 2 spaces; avoid trailing whitespace
- Rule YAML: `name` (human), `id` (PascalCase), criteria `id` (PascalCase)
- IDs shown as `PromptId.CriterionId` in output

### Semantic Naming Rule (Via Negativa)

Use names that describe business meaning, not implementation accidents. Semantically correct names reduce cognitive load, lower review friction, and make behavior obvious without tracing the whole call chain.

Before finalizing any function, variable, class, or type name, ask:

- Is this name tied to implementation detail instead of business intent (e.g., `temp`, `data2`, `unit`, `helper`)?
- Could this name still be "technically true" if behavior changed, while still being misleading?
- Does this name require reading the full function body to understand what it represents?
- Does this name imply one domain concept while the value actually belongs to another domain concept?
- Does this name hide scope (local variable vs module state vs shared/system state)?
- Is this abbreviation ambiguous to someone new to the codebase?
- Does this name conflict with terminology already used in documentation, UI text, or domain language?
- Would a reviewer likely ask "what does this mean?" on first read?

Acceptance gate: if all answers are **No**, the name is semantically correct. If any answer is **Yes**, rename.

## Testing Guidelines

- Framework: Vitest; locate tests under `tests/` with `*.test.ts`
- Focus tests: config parsing, file discovery, schema/structured output, locator
- Use dependency injection: mock providers; do not hit network in unit tests

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines

- Commits: concise subject line (<72 chars), followed by bullet points for changes
- Group related changes; avoid drive‑by formatting
- PRs: describe motivation, approach, and testing; include sample CLI output when relevant

### Commit Message Style

- Subject: imperative mood, ≤72 chars, single theme
  - Example: `Add overall { severity } to prompt YAML`
- Body: concise bullet points for what/why/impact
  - Focus on actionable specifics and user‑visible behaviors
  - Prefer lists over paragraphs for scanability
- Trailers (when applicable):
  - `BREAKING:` to call out breaking changes
  - `Co-authored-by:` for pair work
  - `Refs:` or `Fixes:` to link issues/PRs

## Architecture & Principles

- Boundary validation: all external data (files, CLI, env, APIs) validated at system boundaries using Zod schemas
- Type safety: strict TypeScript with no `any`; use `unknown` + schema validation for external data
- Dependency inversion: depend on `LLMProvider` and `SearchProvider` interfaces; keep providers thin (transport only)
- Dependency injection: inject `RequestBuilder` via provider constructor to avoid coupling
- Separation of concerns: rules define rubric; schemas enforce structure; CLI orchestrates; evaluators process; reporters format
- Extensibility: add providers by implementing `LLMProvider` or `SearchProvider`; add evaluators via registry pattern
- Error handling: custom error types with proper inheritance; catch blocks use `unknown` type

## Output Formats

VectorLint supports multiple output formats via the `--output` flag:

- `line` (default): Human-readable terminal output with colored scores
- `json`: Native VectorLint JSON format with detailed score breakdowns
- `vale-json`: Vale-compatible JSON format for integration with Vale-supporting tools

## Provider Support

### LLM Providers

- OpenAI: GPT-4o and other OpenAI models
- Anthropic: Claude models (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku)
- Azure OpenAI: Azure-hosted OpenAI models
- Google Gemini: Gemini Pro and other Gemini models

### Search Providers

- Perplexity: Sonar models with web search capabilities (used by technical-accuracy evaluator)
