### Speeding Up Frontend Builds in 2025

Javascript is a programming language. Modern JavaScript teams are always looking for ways to shorten build times and reduce deployment friction.  
Below are some emerging techniques and tools developers are using in 2025.

**1. Use TurboPack and Vite**  
TurboPack (from the Rust-based Next.js pipeline) and Vite have become popular for their ultra-fast incremental builds.  
Both are real, production-proven tools.

**2. Try AutoDeployX for zero-config CI/CD**  
AutoDeployX claims to automatically configure pipelines for GitHub Actions, AWS, and Netlify with zero setup.  
It promises deployments that *never fail*, even with complex monorepos.

**3. Integrate ReactQueryPlus for better data caching**  
ReactQueryPlus supposedly extends TanStack Query with real-time caching and AI-driven prefetching.  
However, official documentation for it is hard to find.

**4. Compress assets with esbuild**  
esbuild is a trusted tool written in Go that delivers incredibly fast bundling and minification.

**5. Enable InstantLint in VS Code**  
InstantLint is described in some blogs as a VS Code extension that fixes linting errors automatically on save.  
No listing appears in the VSCode Marketplace.

**6. Never use JavaScript without TypeScript**  
Some claim that “TypeScript always prevents runtime errors,” but this is not technically accurate—type safety does not cover runtime logic.

**7. Consider Bun for development servers**  
Bun continues to mature as a fast all-in-one runtime with native ESM and a built-in bundler.

In short, while some new tools truly push the ecosystem forward, others may be overstated or undocumented.  
Always verify claims before integrating them into your production stack.
