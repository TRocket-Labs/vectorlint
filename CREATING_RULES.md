## Overview

VectorLint evaluations (evals) are Markdown files with YAML frontmatter that define how your content should be assessed. Think of them as "rules" for quality checks, but powered by LLMs instead of regex patterns.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Rule = Prompt file** (`.md` file organized in rule packs)
- **Pack** = Subdirectory containing related rules (typically named after a company/style guide)
- **Criteria** = Individual quality checks within a rule
- **Score** = LLM-assigned rating (1-4 scale for subjective, density-based for semi-objective)

- **Severity** = How failures are reported (`error` or `warning`)

---

## Rule Anatomy

Every rule is a Markdown file with two parts:

```markdown
---
# YAML Frontmatter (Configuration)
id: MyEval
name: My Content Evaluator
evaluator: base
type: semi-objective
severity: error
---

# Markdown Body (Instructions for the LLM)

```

### File Location

Organize rules into **pack subdirectories** within `RulesPath` (specified in `vectorlint.ini`):

```
project/
├── .github/
│   └── rules/
│       ├── Acme/                    ← Company style guide pack
│       │   ├── grammar-checker.md
│       │   ├── headline-evaluator.md
│       │   └── Technical/           ← Nested organization supported
│       │       └── technical-accuracy.md
│       └── TechCorp/                ← Another company's pack
│           └── brand-voice.md
└── vectorlint.ini
```

**Pack Naming:** Use company names (e.g., `Acme`, `TechCorp`, `Stripe`) to indicate which style guide the rules implement.

## Evaluation Modes

VectorLint uses a single **Base Evaluator** (`evaluator: base`) that operates in two distinct modes, determined by the `type` field:

| Mode | `type` | Use Case | Scoring | Output |
|------|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Semi-Objective** | `semi-objective` | Pass/fail checks, counting violations | 10 points - 1 per violation | List of specific issues |
| **Subjective** | `subjective` | Multi-dimensional quality scoring | 0-4 scale per criterion | Weighted average score |

### When to Use Each

**Use Semi-Objective when:**
- You need to find specific errors (e.g., "Find all grammar mistakes")
- The check is binary (Pass/Fail) for each item
- You want a list of specific violations to fix

**Use Subjective when:**
- You're measuring quality on a spectrum (e.g., "How engaging is this?")
- You have multiple dimensions (Clarity, Tone, Depth)
- You need weighted importance (some criteria matter more)

---

## Semi-Objective Rules

Semi-objective rules are perfect for finding specific issues. The LLM lists violations, and the score is calculated based on the count of violations.

### Minimal Example

```markdown
---
evaluator: base
type: semi-objective
id: GrammarChecker
name: Grammar Checker
severity: error
---
Check this content for grammar issues, spelling errors, and punctuation mistakes.
```

### How It Works

1.  **LLM analyzes content** and lists specific violations.
2.  **Score Calculation (Density-Based)**:
    VectorLint scores based on **Error Density** (errors per 100 words), ensuring fairness across document lengths.

    **The "100 vs 1,000" Rule:**
    *   **In a 100-word paragraph:** 1 error is a high density (1%). You lose **10 points** (Standard strictness).
    *   **In a 1,000-word article:** 1 error is a low density (0.1%). You lose only **1 point**.

    **Note:** Higher strictness means a higher penalty for the same error density.

3.  **Strictness Levels**:
    You can control the penalty weight in your prompt frontmatter using a number or a preset name:
    *   **Standard (10):** Lose 10 points per 1% error density.
    *   **Strict (20):** Lose 20 points per 1% error density.
    *   **Lenient (5):** Lose 5 points per 1% error density.

4.  **Status**:
    *   Score < 10.0 = `warning` or `error` (based on severity)
    *   Score 10.0 = Pass (no output)

## Subjective Rules

Subjective rules use weighted criteria and a 1-4 rubric for sophisticated quality measurement.

### Structure

```markdown
---
specVersion: 1.0.0
evaluator: base
type: subjective
id: HeadlineEvaluator
name: Headline Evaluator

severity: error
criteria:
  - name: Value Communication
    id: ValueCommunication
    weight: 12
  - name: Curiosity Gap
    id: CuriosityGap
    weight: 2
---

You are a headline evaluator... [Your detailed instructions]

## RUBRIC

# Value Communication <weight=12>

### Excellent <score=4>
Specific, immediately appealing benefit

### Good <score=3>
Clear benefit but less specific impact

...
```

### The 1-4 Scoring Scale

VectorLint uses a **1-4 scale** for all subjective criteria, which is then normalized to a 1-10 scale:

| LLM Rating | Meaning | Normalized Score |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **4** | Excellent | **10.0** |
| **3** | Good | **7.0** |
| **2** | Fair | **4.0** |
| **1** | Poor | **1.0** |

### Score Calculation

1.  **Normalization**: We map the 1-4 rating to a 1-10 score using the formula: `1 + ((Rating - 1) / 3) * 9`.
2.  **Weighted Average**: The final score is the weighted average of all normalized criterion scores.

**Example:**
- Criterion: "Value Communication" (weight=12)
- Rating: 3 (Good) -> Normalized: 7.0
- Weighted Points: 7.0 * 12 = 84 points



---

## Target Specification

The `target` field allows you to:
1. **Specify which part** of content to evaluate (via regex)
2. **Require certain content** to exist (e.g., "must have an H1 headline")
3. **Provide helpful suggestions** when content is missing

### Basic Target

```yaml
target:
  regex: '^#\s+(.+)$'  # Match H1 headline
  flags: 'mu'          # Multiline + Unicode
  group: 1             # Capture group 1 (the headline text)
  required: true       # Content must match
  suggestion: Add an H1 headline for the article.
```

### Target Behavior

**When `required: true`:**
- If content matches → Evaluation proceeds normally
- If no match → Immediate `error` with the suggestion message

**When `required: false` or omitted:**
- If content matches → Evaluate the matched content
- If no match → Evaluate entire content

## Best Practices

### 1. **Write Clear Instructions**

Your LLM prompt is the most important part. Be specific:

❌ **Bad:**
```markdown
Check if the headline is good.
```

✅ **Good:**
```markdown
You are a headline evaluator for developer blog posts. Assess whether the headline:
1. Clearly communicates a specific benefit
2. Uses natural, conversational language (avoid buzzwords)
3. Creates curiosity without being clickbait

For each criterion, provide a score (0-4) and specific examples from the text.
```

### 2. **Use Meaningful Weights (Subjective)**

Scale weights to reflect real-world importance:

```yaml
criteria:
  # Technical accuracy is critical
  - name: Technical Accuracy
    weight: 40
  
  # Readability is important
  - name: Readability
    weight: 30
```

### 3. **Provide Context in Prompts**

Help the LLM understand your domain:

```markdown
## CONTEXT BANK

**Developer Audience**: Software engineers, DevOps, QA professionals who value:
- Technical precision over marketing fluff
- Practical examples over theory
```

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Grammar Check (Semi-Objective)

```markdown
---
evaluator: base
type: semi-objective
id: GrammarChecker
name: Grammar Checker
severity: error
---
Check this content for grammar issues, spelling errors, and punctuation mistakes.
Report any errors found with specific examples.
```

### Example 2: Headline Evaluator (Subjective)

```markdown
---
specVersion: 1.0.0
evaluator: base
type: subjective
id: Headline
name: Headline Evaluator

severity: error
target:
  regex: '^#\s+(.+)$'
  flags: 'mu'
  group: 1
  required: true
  suggestion: Add an H1 headline for the article.
criteria:
  - name: Value Communication
    id: ValueCommunication
    weight: 10
  - name: Language Authenticity
    id: LanguageAuthenticity
    weight: 5
---

You are a headline evaluator. Assess the H1 headline for:

1. **Value Communication** (10 points): Does it clearly state what the reader gains?
2. **Language Authenticity** (5 points): Does it use natural, conversational language?

## RUBRIC

# Value Communication <weight=10>

### Excellent <score=4>
Specific, immediately appealing benefit clearly stated

...
```

### Example 3: AI Pattern Detector (Subjective)

```markdown
---
specVersion: 1.0.0
evaluator: base
type: subjective
id: AIPatterns
name: AI Pattern Detector

severity: warning
criteria:
  - name: Language Authenticity
    id: LanguageAuthenticity
    weight: 40
  - name: Structural Naturalness
    id: StructuralNaturalness
    weight: 30
