# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our promise
We want this project to be a place where people can contribute, learn, and ship. We commit to a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of background or identity. We will act in ways that keep the community open, welcoming, and healthy.

## How we work together
Positive behavior includes:
- Showing empathy and kindness.
- Respecting different opinions and experiences.
- Giving clear, constructive feedback and receiving it well.
- Owning mistakes, fixing them, and sharing what we learned.
- Optimizing for the whole community, not just ourselves.

Unacceptable behavior includes:
- Sexualized language or imagery and unwanted attention of any kind.
- Insults, trolling, or personal or political attacks.
- Harassment in public or private spaces.
- Sharing others’ private information without consent.
- Any conduct that a reasonable person would find inappropriate in a professional setting.

*Example:* It is fine to disagree about a lint rule or test approach. It is not fine to attack someone’s character or background. Propose a change with reasons and avoid sarcasm and dog-piles.

## Where this applies
This Code applies across all project spaces: the repository (issues, pull requests, wiki), and **GitHub Discussions**. It also applies when someone represents the project in public spaces.

## Reporting a problem
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, report it to the maintainers at **jay@tinyrocket.dev**. Include links, screenshots, dates, and a short summary if you can. We will review and respond promptly and fairly, keeping the reporter’s privacy and safety in mind.

## How we enforce
Maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code. We may edit, remove, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, pull requests, and other contributions that break these guidelines. When we moderate, we aim to explain why.

### Community impact guidelines

1) **Correction**  
**Impact:** Inappropriate language or behavior that seems unintentional.  
**Consequence:** Private written reminder of the guidelines and why the behavior was not OK. A public apology may be requested.

2) **Warning**  
**Impact:** A single serious incident or repeated issues.  
**Consequence:** Official warning with stated conditions. No direct contact with the affected people or moderators for a set period. Further issues may result in a temporary or permanent ban.

3) **Temporary ban**  
**Impact:** Serious or repeated violations.  
**Consequence:** Time-boxed ban from all community spaces and interactions. Attempting to bypass the ban can lead to a permanent ban.

4) **Permanent ban**  
**Impact:** Pattern of violations, harassment of individuals, or hate toward protected classes.  
**Consequence:** Permanent removal from all community spaces.

## Appeals
If you believe an action was taken in error, you may appeal by emailing **jay@tinyrocket.dev** within **14 days**. A different maintainer will review the case where possible.
